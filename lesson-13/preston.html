                <h3>THAT FAMOUS PRESTON NIGHT RODEO</h3>
                <p>
                    Summer in Preston is marked by the PRCA and WPRA approved, more than half-century-old 
                    “That Famous Preston Night Rodeo”, when cowboys and girls from national and international 
                    fame come to compete and rise to the challenge only buckin’ broncs and bulls can offer.<br><br>
                    There’s nothing quite like sitting in the stands, tasting the dust and experiencing the 
                    courage of these participants and cheering them on to victory. The Rodeo, begun in 1936, is 
                    the second oldest night-time rodeo, under lights, and to add to its excitement is the charm 
                    of Rodeo Days – a sidewalk sale extraordinaire! And of course, what Rodeo would be complete 
                    without a carnival, hamburger stands and world class entertainment?
