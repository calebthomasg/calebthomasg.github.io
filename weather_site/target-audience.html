        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience is adults who actively check the weather on a daily or weekly basis. These adults typically commute to work in some fashion. These adults rely on weather updates so they know what to wear, which route to take to work and what vehicle to transport in.<br><br></p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <h3>Persona 1:</h3>
        <p>Amelio lives five blocks from his job at the local hospital. When the weather is good, he loves to ride his bike to work. Every morning, Amelio checks the weather to see if it is a good day to take the bike or to see if he needs to take his car. When there is precipitation, Amelio will not take is bike. When he checks the weather, he checks both his departing and returning commutes just in case it's sunny in the morning and raining in the evening.</p>
        <h3>Persona 2:</h3>
        <p>Jules is a project manager for a large corporation and flies across the country at least once a month. Before he leaves on a work trip, he checks the forecast in the area he is traveling. He likes to know what a full week's forecast will look like so he knows what clothes to pack and how close his hotel needs to be to the office he will be working at.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Scenario 1:</h3>
        <p>The user of the site wants to know the forecast for the day, which includes an hour by hour view of the temperature, humidity, air quality, and major weather events.</p>
        <h3>Scenario 2:</h3>
        <p>The user wants to know the weekly forecast which will give them the average temperature for each day of the week and major weather events. </p>
        <h3>Scenario 3:</h3>
        <p>Some user is checking the site to see what will be a good week to take time off to travel across the state to see their parents.</p>
        <h3>Scenario 4:</h3>
        <p>Someone checks the site so that they know if the upcoming week is going to be too hot for their dog to be outside all day.</p>
        <h3>Scenario 5:</h3>
        <p>A local running race director checks the forecast to see what type of gear the race participants need to bring for their upcoming race.</p>
