        <h1>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
        <p>The target audience for this site is Preston citizens and Preston business owners.<br><br></p>
        <h2>PERSONAS</h2>
        <h3>PERSONA/SCENARIO 1:</h3>
        <p>Amelio owns The Slice, a local pizzeria in Preston. He has not been involved with the local business owner community in town, but is interested in 
            learning about how he can get his business advertised in the community. He was encouraged to join the Chamber of Commerce, which could advertise
            his business and help support events at his restaurant. He gets on the Chamber of Commerce website to fill out a form so he can join.
        </p>
        <h3>PERSONA/SCENARIO 2:</h3>
        <p>Jules recently opened a boutique along Main Street in Preston, but doesn't know any of the business owners along Main Street. She's wanting to 
            contact the business owners around her to see if she can create coupons for her store that will also promote her neighboring businesses to draw
            more customers to the area. She goes to the Chamber of Commerce directly online to find the contact information for those businesses.
